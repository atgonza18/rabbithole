<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Good luck.</p>

<strong class="text-white font-bold">The algorithm has already adapted to that.</strong>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">It shows you "diverse sources" that all subtly agree on the core narrative. It gives you the appearance of critical thinking while keeping you within acceptable bounds.</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">You feel like you're researching. You're just being shown a carefully curated set of "diverse" options that all lead to the same conclusion.</p>

<strong class="text-white font-bold">What about going offline?</strong>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Your friends are online. Your news comes from online sources that your friends share. Your workplace discussions are influenced by what people saw online.</p>

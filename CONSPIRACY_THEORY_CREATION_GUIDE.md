# Conspiracy Theory Creation Guide

A comprehensive guide for creating immersive, thought-provoking conspiracy theory content for Rabbit Hole.

## üö® CRITICAL RULE: NO CORRECT ANSWERS üö®

**There are NO right or wrong answers in Rabbit Hole questions. PERIOD.**

- Do NOT include `correctAnswer` field in questions
- ALL answer options should be equally valid and unsettling
- Questions advance the story, not test knowledge
- Users reflect on their choice, then continue - no retry
- No green checkmarks, no red X's, no "Try Again"

## Philosophy: Immersion Over Education

Questions in Rabbit Hole should NOT be factual quizzes. They should:
- Put the user IN the conspiracy theory scenario
- Provoke existential questions and chills
- Make users question their own reality and memories
- Feel like psychological assessments, not tests
- Have no clear "right or wrong" - all answers reveal something unsettling about reality or the user

## Question Design Principles

### 1. **Make It Personal**
Bad: "What year was CERN's Large Hadron Collider activated?"
Good: "You remember opening that children's book as a kid. Close your eyes. What did the spine say?"

### 2. **Create Cognitive Dissonance**
Questions should make users doubt their own memories and perceptions.
- Reference specific childhood memories
- Ask about vivid details they "should" remember
- Contrast their memory with current reality

### 3. **No Quiz Vibes**
Avoid:
- Trivia questions with dates/numbers
- "What percentage..." type questions
- Fill-in-the-blank factual answers
- Academic tone

Instead:
- Scenario-based choices
- Emotional responses
- "Which disturbs you more?"
- "Have you experienced this?"

### 4. **All Answers Are Disturbing**
Each option should reveal a different unsettling implication:
- Option A: You're from another timeline
- Option B: Your memories were altered
- Option C: You're still in the old reality but slipping
- Option D: You've always known something was wrong

## Question Types & Examples

### Type 1: Memory Verification
Put users in a moment where they must confront their memory vs. reality.

**Example:**
```
Question: "Picture yourself at age 7, holding that Berenstain Bears book. You can see the cover. Feel the pages. What does your memory tell you?"

Options:
a) "I clearly remember 'Berenstein' - I can see the letters"
   (Explanation: You may be a consciousness that shifted from Timeline A. Your memories are real - just not from THIS reality.)

b) "I remember 'Berenstain' - it was always that way"
   (Explanation: Your consciousness seamlessly integrated into this timeline. Or perhaps your memories were successfully overwritten.)

c) "I don't remember which it was - both feel wrong now"
   (Explanation: Uncertainty is common in those experiencing active timeline convergence. Your mind is caught between realities.)

d) "I never read those books, but I still somehow 'remember' the wrong spelling"
   (Explanation: This is most disturbing - false memories implanted in minds that never encountered the original. Why?)
```

### Type 2: Scenario Choices
Present situations and ask what the user would do or feel.

**Example:**
```
Question: "You're looking at a world map. New Zealand is in the 'wrong' place. Your stomach drops. What do you do?"

Options:
a) "Close the map and never look again - some truths are too much"
b) "Take a photo before reality 'corrects' itself again"
c) "Question if you've gone insane"
d) "Feel relief that you're not the only one who notices"
```

### Type 3: Experiential Polls
Ask if they've experienced specific phenomena.

**Example:**
```
Question: "Have you ever had this experience: You KNOW a fact about the world, you'd bet your life on it... then you look it up and you're 'wrong.' Not misremembering - WRONG. Like the universe is gaslighting you."

Options:
a) "Yes, multiple times - and it's getting more frequent"
b) "Yes, once or twice - it haunts me"
c) "No, but reading this makes me uncomfortable"
d) "No, and I don't believe it happens to others either"
```

### Type 4: Belief Resonance
Which explanation disturbs them most?

**Example:**
```
Question: "Millions share the exact same 'false' memory of Berenstein. Which explanation unsettles you most?"

Options:
a) "CERN's experiments are merging parallel timelines"
b) "We're in a simulation and they're editing the code"
c) "Our memories are being mass-manipulated"
d) "This reality is the 'wrong' one and we're trapped here"
```

## Content Structure Guidelines

### Section Flow
Each conspiracy theory should follow this narrative arc:

1. **The Hook** (Section 1)
   - Start with something familiar and relatable
   - Introduce the glitch/anomaly
   - Create initial doubt
   - Questions: Memory-based, personal

2. **The Evidence** (Section 2)
   - Show patterns and connections
   - Present data that seems impossible to dismiss
   - Build tension with "coincidences"
   - Questions: Experiential polls, scenario choices

3. **The Explanation** (Section 3)
   - Offer the conspiracy theory framework
   - Connect to larger systems (CERN, simulation, etc.)
   - Make the impossible seem plausible
   - Questions: Belief resonance, testing understanding

4. **The Implication** (Section 4)
   - What this means for reality
   - Who's behind it and why
   - What happens to those who know
   - Questions: Choice-based, what would you do

### Writing Tone

**Do:**
- Write in second person when appropriate ("You remember...")
- Use present tense for immediacy
- Include specific, vivid details
- Build dread gradually
- Use short sentences for impact
- Create "reveal" moments

**Don't:**
- Write like a textbook
- Use overly academic language
- Explain everything - leave some mysteries
- Make it campy or humorous (unless intentional)
- Rush the build-up

### Question Placement

- **Every 2-3 pages** should have a question
- Place questions AFTER building tension, not before
- Questions should feel like "checkpoints" where users process what they've learned
- Final sections can have fewer questions - let the narrative flow

## Content Formatting & Styling

**CRITICAL:** All content must be formatted as **styled HTML** for maximum visual impact and readability.

### Formatting Essentials

**Headlines:**
```html
<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black mb-6 text-green-400">Your Attention-Grabbing Title</h2>
```

**Paragraphs:**
```html
<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Your compelling narrative text goes here...</p>
```

**Bold/Emphasis:**
```html
<strong class="text-white font-bold">Critical information</strong>
<em class="text-yellow-300">Subtle emphasis or inner thoughts</em>
```

**Callout Boxes (for warnings, key points):**
```html
<div class="bg-slate-800/50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 my-6">
  <p class="text-yellow-400 font-semibold mb-2">Key Point Header</p>
  <p class="text-slate-300">Important information that needs to stand out...</p>
</div>
```

**Lists (use subtle formatting):**
```html
<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Here's what we know:
- Point one with impact
- Point two building tension
- Point three that makes them question</p>
```

**Color Coding for Emotional Impact:**
- `text-red-400` - Danger, warnings, disturbing revelations
- `text-yellow-400` - Caution, key terms, highlights
- `text-green-400` - Headers, progress, "truth"
- `text-white` - Critical bold text
- `text-slate-300` - Standard readable text
- `text-slate-400` - Subtle, secondary information

### Formatting Patterns by Page Type

**Opening Pages (Build Dread):**
```html
<h2 class="text-red-400 text-3xl font-black mb-4">‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Title</h2>

<p class="text-lg mb-4">Hook them with something <strong class="text-white">they can't ignore</strong>.</p>

<div class="bg-slate-800/50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-4 my-6">
  <p class="text-red-400 font-semibold">This is dangerous knowledge.</p>
</div>
```

**Evidence Pages (Build Credibility):**
```html
<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black mb-6 text-green-400">The Pattern</h2>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Present facts that seem impossible to dispute...</p>

<strong class="text-white font-bold">Documented Evidence:</strong>
- Bullet points that build the case
- Each one more disturbing than the last
```

**Revelation Pages (Mind-Blowing Moments):**
```html
<p class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 my-6 text-center">The truth you weren't ready for</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Build to the revelation slowly...</p>

<p class="text-center text-2xl my-6 text-red-400">Then hit them with it.</p>
```

**Closing Pages (Leave Them Thinking):**
```html
<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Question after question...</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">No answers...</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Just implications...</p>

<strong class="text-white font-bold">And the knowledge that changes everything.</strong>
```

### Visual Rhythm Tips

- **Vary paragraph length** - Short sentences create tension. Longer passages build atmosphere.
- **Use whitespace** - Don't wall-of-text. Let revelations breathe.
- **Strategic ALL CAPS** - Use sparingly for maximum impact in `<strong>` tags
- **Italics for thoughts** - Use `<em>` for internal dialogue or eerie observations
- **Center key phrases** - `text-center` for punch lines that need emphasis
- **Build with spacing** - Use `my-6` for dramatic pauses between concepts

### Example of Great Formatting

```html
<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black mb-6 text-green-400">The Uncomfortable Truth</h2>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">You've noticed it. That feeling when you're scrolling.</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Something's <em class="text-yellow-300">wrong</em>.</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The conversations feel hollow. The engagement feels manufactured. The connections feel <strong class="text-white font-bold">fake</strong>.</p>

<div class="bg-slate-800/50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 my-6">
  <p class="text-yellow-400 font-semibold mb-2">And you're right to feel that way.</p>
  <p class="text-slate-300">Because what you're experiencing isn't paranoia.</p>
</div>

<p class="text-center text-xl my-6 text-slate-400">It's pattern recognition.</p>

<p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Your brain detected something the algorithms hoped you wouldn't notice:</p>

<p class="text-xl font-bold text-red-400 my-6 text-center">Most of it isn't real.</p>
```

## Technical Implementation

### Theory Lock/Unlock System

**CRITICAL: Follow this pattern for ALL theories:**

1. **First theory (order: 0)** - ALWAYS `isLocked: false` (starter theory, available to all users)
2. **All other theories** - ALWAYS `isLocked: true` (must be unlocked by completing previous theories)

**Theory Order Convention:**
- Order 0: Unlocked starter theory (e.g., Berenstain Bears)
- Order 1+: Locked theories that unlock progressively

**How Unlocking Works:**
- User completes a theory ‚Üí earns 1 key
- System automatically unlocks a random locked theory
- User sees celebration modal with the newly unlocked theory
- Newly unlocked theory appears on home page path

### In Convex Seed Files

**Theory Creation Pattern:**
```typescript
// FIRST THEORY (order: 0) - Must be unlocked
const theoryId = await ctx.db.insert("theories", {
  title: "Your Starter Theory",
  description: "Description here",
  difficulty: "beginner" as const,
  order: 0,  // FIRST theory
  icon: "üéØ",
  isLocked: false,  // ‚ùó MUST be false for order: 0
  estimatedTimeMinutes: 60,
});

// SUBSEQUENT THEORIES (order: 1+) - Must be locked
const theoryId = await ctx.db.insert("theories", {
  title: "Your Advanced Theory",
  description: "Description here",
  difficulty: "intermediate" as const,
  order: 2,  // Any order > 0
  icon: "üîí",
  isLocked: true,  // ‚ùó MUST be true for order > 0
  estimatedTimeMinutes: 45,
});
```

**Question Creation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Example of a properly structured question
await ctx.db.insert("questions", {
  pageId: pageId,
  questionType: "multiple_choice",
  questionText: "You're staring at the Monopoly Man. No monocle. But you SWEAR he had one. You can picture it clearly. What's your first thought?",
  options: [
    {
      id: "a",
      text: "I'm losing my mind - my memory is broken"
    },
    {
      id: "b",
      text: "Someone changed it and is covering it up"
    },
    {
      id: "c",
      text: "I've shifted into a parallel universe"
    },
    {
      id: "d",
      text: "My memories were implanted or altered"
    },
  ],
  // NO correctAnswer field - all answers are equally valid
  explanation: "All of these reactions are documented among those experiencing the Mandela Effect. There is no 'wrong' answer - only different interpretations of the same impossible situation. The real question is: why do they ALL feel plausible?"
});
```

### Explanation Guidelines

Explanations should:
- Validate the user's choice
- Add a twist or additional disturbing detail
- NOT feel like a "correct answer" explanation
- Sometimes ask MORE questions instead of answering
- Connect to the larger narrative

**Example Explanations:**

Good:
```
"You chose to document everything. Smart. But others have tried. They report their evidence disappearing - files corrupted, photos deleted, even physical journals going missing. How will you protect what you discover?"
```

Bad:
```
"Correct! Documentation is important for tracking Mandela Effects."
```

## Question Type Distribution

For a full theory (4 sections, 12-16 pages):

- **Memory Verification**: 2-3 questions
- **Scenario Choices**: 2-3 questions
- **Experiential Polls**: 1-2 questions
- **Belief Resonance**: 2-3 questions
- **No Question Pages**: 6-8 pages (for pure narrative flow)

## Content Examples by Topic

### For CERN/Physics Theories
- Don't ask about quantum mechanics facts
- DO ask: "If you could ask a CERN physicist one question they'd never answer publicly, what would it be?"

### For Mandela Effect Theories
- Don't list examples and ask "which is real"
- DO ask: "Which false memory haunts you most? Be honest."

### For Simulation Theories
- Don't ask "what is the simulation hypothesis"
- DO ask: "You find proof we're in a simulation. Do you tell anyone, or would that get you deleted?"

### For Government Conspiracy Theories
- Don't ask dates and facts
- DO ask: "You have evidence that could expose everything. Do you release it, knowing what happens to whistleblowers?"

## Testing Your Questions

Before finalizing, ask yourself:

1. **Would I feel uncomfortable answering this?** (Good)
2. **Could this be on a quiz show?** (Bad - rewrite)
3. **Do all the answers feel equally plausible and unsettling?** (Good)
4. **Am I teaching facts or creating an experience?** (Should be creating experience)
5. **Will the user think about this question later, maybe at 3am?** (Goal achieved)

## Advanced Techniques

### The False Choice
Sometimes all options point to the same disturbing conclusion:
```
"Which explanation comforts you most?"
a) Your memory is faulty (You can't trust yourself)
b) Reality was altered (You can't trust reality)
c) You're being manipulated (You can't trust others)
d) None of these comfort me (You see the trap)
```

### The Escalation
Questions should get more personal and unsettling as the theory progresses:
- Section 1: "Have you heard of the Mandela Effect?"
- Section 2: "Do you have any Mandela Effect memories?"
- Section 3: "Which of your memories do you trust least now?"
- Section 4: "Knowing what you know, can you ever trust your memory again?"

### The Meta Question
Sometimes, ask about the experience of going through the theory itself:
```
"You've made it this far down the rabbit hole. How do you feel right now?"
a) "Fascinated and wanting more"
b) "Anxious and wanting to stop"
c) "Skeptical but unable to stop reading"
d) "Like I've known this all along"
```

## Final Reminders

- **Immersion is everything** - users should feel like participants, not students
- **Emotional impact over factual accuracy** - this is fiction, make it compelling
- **Questions should haunt** - they should stick with users after they finish
- **No right answers** - only different levels of disturbing implications
- **Trust the conspiracy** - commit fully to the narrative, don't hedge

*Remember: You're not creating an educational course. You're creating an experience that makes users question reality itself. Make them feel it.*
